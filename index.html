								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For our capstone project, our group chose to help Dr. Goldberg with his current research regarding robot 
									hotel services. The dataset currently contains 32,829 reviews that were scraped from TripAdvisor on 
									09/03/2021. We will be using text mining and machine learning on TripAdvisor reviews of robot hotels. 
									We're interested in understanding how robots are used in hotels (check-in/check-out, room service, 
									cleaning, etc.) and how people feel about each of those uses (positive or negative). We're hoping to 
									perform sentiment analysis on the reviews and build a machine learning model to classify unseen reviews. 
									We're also planning on creating some sort of visualization/dashboard to compare aspects of different 
									hotels. For example, maybe one hotel has effective check-in robots but awful cleaning robots; maybe a 
									different hotel has good cleaning robots but mediocre room service robots, etc. This will be done by 
									separating robot service review topics into two categories, with multiple subcategories underneath. 
									The two primary service categories will be service quality attributes, and operation area attributes 
									Service quality will include: humanization design, signature design, service charge, stability, speed, 
									and technology. Operation area attributes will include: rooms, reception, concierge, luggage, and dining.

								<h3>Data</h3>
								<p>
									The dataset for this research was collected by Dr. Goldberg using a python-based text mining script on 
									TripAdvisor reviews. The data was collected from 45 hotels on an international scale. Refer to figure 
									x.x.x to see the descriptive statistics for the data. With the initial gathering, 32,829 reviews were 
									collected. However, not all reviews refer to robots. Using keywords provided by Luo et al. to filter 
									the text of the hotel reviews, Dr. Goldberg was able to narrow down the dataset to a total of 3,955 
									reviews. Once the raw dataset was complete, it was our job to manually tag the reviews using the PAMTAG 
									system that Dr. Goldberg helped build during his PhD at Virginia Tech. This site randomly assigns the 
									reviews to each account and it's a central place to store and reconcile the results. PAMTAG made the 
									tagging process streamline but tedious. For each review we were presented the review itself, the type 
									of service provided, and the sentiment the review gave towards the robot service (if any).

								<h3>Cleaning/Preparing</h3>
								<p>
									Due to the random nature of assignment some reviews had more than one person tag them. This posed a 
									small problem for us as we had to ensure that everyone tagged reasonably consistently across the 
									thousands of reviews. Here we care about reliability for two things: robot mention(s) (how the robot 
									was used) and sentiment (positive/negative/no robot mentions). It&#39;s possible that one of the tags was 
									more reliable than the other, and if so, we should be aware of it.<br><br>
									Due to how the robot mention(s) field was handled during the tagging process it is possible for a single 
									review to have multiple tags as it was a "select all that apply" situation. For example, it was possible 
									to see a tag of [Check-in/check-out, General]. To clean the data for modeling we had to break these tags 
									into multiple columns. The process was each column is a binary yes/no for check-in/check-out, another 
									column is a binary yes/no for general or not; etc. Having each tag properly split we began measuring 
									reliability. The first method was using simple Accuracy Percentage. This is the most straightforward: 
									out of all the overlapping cases, how many did we agree on? For example, if there were 100 overlapping 
									cases, and we agreed 90 times, then the accuracy percentage is 90%. The second method was using Cohen&#39;s 
									Kappa. This is a comparison of our agreement percentage to random chance. The scale is from -1 to 1. 0 
									is the level of agreement we'd expect from random chance. 1 means complete agreement all the time. 0.5 is 
									somewhere in between. -0.5 means we are worse than random chance.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/AccuracyScoreKohens.PNG" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									Once we calculated out initial Accuracy percentages and Cohen&#39;s Kappa, we found that the results for “room 
									service” and “delivery” were quite poor. Dr. Goldbergs hypothesis was that the differentiation between the 
									two was slim. We combined these two categories which drastically increased Cohen&#39;s Kappa.<br><br>
									The final step was to consolidate all the newly formatted and cleaned data into something we could use for 
									training machine learning models. Being that some reviews had multiple taggings, we had to decide what to 
									do if the taggings did not agree. I.e. if one person tagged “check-in/check-out” and the other person did 
									not, what do we do? Dr. Goldbergs suggestion was as follows:
									<ul>
										<li>
											If there is an odd number of tags (if one person tagged the review or three people tagged the review), 
											then we can go with the majority decision.
										</li>
										<li>
											If there is an even number of tags, choose the negative (0) class by default. That is, if one person 
											said “check-in/check-out” (1) and the other person said “no check-in/check-out” (0) then go with “no 
											check-in/check-out” (0). This ensures that anything that is kept as a 1 is unambiguously a 1.
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
								<p>
									<h4>Intro</h4>
									Exploratory analysis is the process of discovering patterns that occur in our dataset to find any characteristics 
									that can be clearly demonstrated through visuals. During our exploration we created a word cloud between positive 
									and negative sentiment, distribution plots, and box plots to further visualize trends. A word cloud is a corpus 
									(bag of words) that visually represents text data which depicts keywords. The words appearing in the cloud vary 
									in importance based on text size and color based on the frequency they appear in the corpus. A distribution plot 
									is a visual representation of the population being sampled. There are several kinds of patterns a plot can follow, 
									however the most common are normal distributions and skewed distributions. A box and whiskers plot is a visual 
									representation of locality, skewness, and spread of data. <br><br>
									<h4>Word Clouds</h4>
									<center><img src="images/pos_wordcloud.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The positive sentiment word cloud quickly demonstrates what words frequently occurre in reviews 
									where the tag was negative. Words with higher frequencies are “bed”, “check”, “staff”, and “service”. To create this visual, we split the loaded 
									dataset into a pandas dataframe then split it into another dataframe filtering on sentiment.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/neg_wordlcoud.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The negative sentiment word cloud quickly demonstrates what words frequently occurre in reviews 
									where the tag was negative. Words with higher frequencies are “bed”, “check”, “staff”, and “service”. To create this visual, we split the loaded 
									dataset into a pandas dataframe then split it into another dataframe filtering on sentiment. Here we also see some overlap between the positive 
									sentiment wordcloud as these are general keywords that appear in most hotel reviews.<br><br>
									<h4>Plots</h4>
									<center><img src="images/sentiment_polarity_distribution.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The plot of sentiment polarity demonstrates a normal distribution with the majority of reviews have a positive sentiment. A sentiment polarity 
									distribution measures between -1 and 1 (-1 being absolutely negative, 0 being completely neutral, and 1 being absolutely positive). 
									We know that the majority of reviews are positive the x-axis has a leftward shift resulting in the median being somewhere around 0.3.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/wordcount.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The plot on review word counts quickly shows us that most reviews are less than 2000 words.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/top20words_w_sw.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The plot above shows us what the 20 most frequent words occurring in reviews are. From this we can also compare the word clouds and see That
									many of the larger words from both clouds appear in this plot. For this plot we have also removed stop words similar to the word cloud.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/top20bigrams_w_sw.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The plot above shows us what the 20 most frequent bigrams occurring in reviews. A bigram is a pair of consecutive words. We can compare this 
									plot to the top 20 words plot and see that many of the stand alone words also appear in the bigrams.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/top20trigrams_w_sw.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The plot above shows us what the 20 most frequent trigrams occurring in reviews. A trigram is similar to a bigram but is three consecutive words.
									Here we see that a similar pattern is followed as the bigram in that many of the bigrams appear in the trigrams.<br><br>
									<center><img src="images/sentiment_polarity_box_plots.png" style="width:700px"></center><br>
									The box plot on sentiment polarity by robot service mentions gives us a quick overview of general statistics per category. Here we can quickly 
									understand where the mean of each category lies as well as the spread and the skewness. We see that the "general" category has the most outlier
									points with and the largest spread, while the cleaning category has the thighest spread and no outliers.<br><br>

								<h3>Modeling Overview</h3>
								<p>
									For our machine learning models, we chose to use a variety of classification algorithms as well as vectorizers. 
									For machine learning models, we chose to use five different ones for our analysis: Random Forests, Neural Networks, 
									Linear Support Vector Machine (SVC), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors. For vectorizers we chose count vectorizer 
									and TF-IDF vectorizer to determine whether the vectorizer used provided any significant changes in our results.<br><br>
									We will be scoring the machine learning models based on the algorithm&#39;s performance on determining the four service 
									categories that we identified via tagging. The four different service categories we focused on were Check-In, Sentiment, 
									Delivery + Room Service, and Cleaning. The four metrics that will be used to rank the machine learning algorithms are 
									accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results will be an average across a set of five-fold cross validation. 
									Below is a breakdown of the four metrics:<br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Accuracy - The accuracy metric is a measure of how many times the model categorized the text of the review correctly.
										</li>
										<li>
											Precision - The precision metric will measure how many times the model claimed the text was of a specific category, and it was correct.
										</li>
										<li>
											Recall - The recall metric will measure out of all the times it labeled a review, how many were correctly labeled.
										</li>
										<li>
											F1 score - The F1 score is a metric that is a combination of Precision and Recall, and is treated as a compromise between the two metrics.
										</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Future Impact</h3>
									The impact of service robots in daily life could be life changing for any individuals and companies alike. By adopting 
									robotic workers, companies could not only save expenses, but workers could refocus their daily tasks to complete 
									more technical duties while the robotic workers do more repetitive tasks. Although the initial cost of many 
									service robots may be more than their human counterparts (in terms of salary paid), the long term benefit for 
									companies would be a drastic decrease in spending (once the robot is paid off). It&#39;s difficult to say exactly 
									how groundbreaking service robots can become in the near future, but with advancements in AI technology as 
									well as general robotic technology the industry is advancing at a very rapid pace. In the next few years we 
									may see more robots working as a concierge service, tour guide, storage worker, and other simpler jobs.<br><br>
									
									<h3>SWOT Analysis</h3>
									When looking at the robot service industry, we can use a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) 
									analysis to quickly identify and understand the business environment to achieve future goals. Strength and Weaknesses 
									are the internal factors (something that can directly affect the company or industry such as manufacturing, employees, 
									and quality), while Opportunities and Threats are external factors (something that is out of the companies control such 
									as the market, economy, etc.). <br><br>
									Analyzing strengths in the robotic service industry, realize that by placing robot service providers at specific locations 
									it allows the human service providers to focus on more technical tasks (Dautenhahn et al., 2006). This can lead to a business 
									(hotel, health care, etc.)  to refocus its tasks thus resulting in guests to further enjoy their stay. By implementing robotic 
									service providers it allows a business to distinguish itself from the competition as robotic service is still a relatively rare 
									occurrence, but in the long term may minimize expenditures (Luo et al., 2021).<br><br>
									However, an overwhelming weakness is that consumers may also oppose using robots for delivering human services for reasons like 
									lacking human touch, and ethical concerns with the potential growth of unemployment rate when robots enter the labor market 
									(Lu Lu et al., 2019). People are scared of being replaced by robots. This not only may cause controversy or disgruntlement 
									amongst employees who work alongside a robot, but also can affect the customer views on a business (Liu and Mattila, 2018). 
									In addition to these concerns, the robotic service may be devalued when human intervention is constantly required to reboot 
									or recover malfunctioning robots (Gale and Mochizuki, 2019).<br><br>
									Having the adoption of robotic services also creates lots of interesting opportunities for a business to thrive upon (Hollander, 2023). 
									The robotic service market in the hotel industry alone is expected to grow from $79 million in 2020 to $338 million by 2025 
									(Allen, 2023).  By using robotic service providers it introduces the opportunity for businesses to save the financial cost of 
									utilizing a human employee (Gale and Mochizuki, 2019). In addition to the savings on human labor, there are potential massive 
									economies of scale in the cost of robots being implemented. The majority of the cost incurred is in the development of the 
									robots (Wirtz et al., 2021), a chatbot or virtual agent can be scaled close to zero incremental cost (Wirtz et al, 2021).<br><br>
									The adoption of robotic services also poses some threats to any company. In the off chance that a manufacturer goes under, the business 
									who purchased a product from the manufacturer will no longer receive support. Another threat comes from the prejudices and 
									anxieties customer-facing robots possess (Wirtz et al, 2021). They could create unease with customers resulting in poor 
									reviews ultimately negatively affecting the business. There is also the implication robots do not perceive emotion to the 
									same capacity as human service providers. Due to this, a robot may offer an awkward or out-of-place response to a 
									disgruntled customer. There is also the fact that robotic services are a long term investment. It is expensive to 
									implement and often times businesses will not see their investments recouped in less than 12 months even if implemented 
									successfully (Wirtz et al, 2021)<br><br>
									In conclusion, there are many factors to consider when implementing some form of robotic service provider. Some will 
									be relatively easy to implement such as a chatbot, while others may incur rather large costs with no guarantee of returns. 
									There is also the ever present concern of customer adoption as well, some people simply do not want to receive service from 
									robots, yet others think it is fascinating. The industry is growing rapidly which makes being an early adopter both dangerous 
									and profitable. By implementing robotic services early as a business there is the possibility of distinguishing your brand 
									amongst competitors as this new feature can create some form of brilliance for customers since few competitors will also provide 
									such a service.<br><br>
